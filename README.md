This is a RUST microservice that uses a protobuf generated gRPC protocol schema to 
perform MongoDB operations required by a chat service currently under development.

It includes a RUST gRPC client to exercise the service for testing purposes while
the chat service is being developed.

It presently uses MongoDB Community Edition to provide NoSQL functionality.
