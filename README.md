This is a RUST microservice that uses a protobuf generated gRPC protocol schema to 
perform MongoDB operations required by a chat service currently under development.

The client provided with this service is included for testing purposes while the
chat system is being developed. 

The MongoDB Community Edition provides NoSQL functionability.
